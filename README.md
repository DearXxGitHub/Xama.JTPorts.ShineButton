>Xamarin.Android Native UI lib button effects like "shining".

_Xamarin.Android_ Native "Shine Button" control. This is a UI lib for Xamarin Android. Creates 'shining' effects. Initial port from [ShineButton](https://github.com/ChadCSong/ShineButton) by [Chad Song](https://github.com/ChadCSong)

This is a ported build, converted from Java to C# for use with the Xamarin MonoFramework. There are only a couple of new additions from the original library currently.
